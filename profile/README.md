## Hi there, we're team AquaFlo!💦

Many Sub-Saharan Africans rely on hand pumps for getting water, with 20% relying on them as their sole water source. An estimated ⅓ of the hand pumps are out of service at any given time, and stay down due to limited information. As a team passionate about using technology for social good, we came up with two different technical solutions: a mobile app and SMS/IVR system to make it accessible for communities to easily set up and address issues effectively and inexpensively!
